üöÄ **Win Your Argument** is an advanced AI-driven application designed to empower users to craft compelling arguments. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies like **Groq**, **Gemini APIs**, and **SearchXNG**, this application extracts insights from a vast array of research papers. Built on a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, Win Your Argument solves complex problems and is set to introduce a **Model United Nations (MUN) Mode** for dynamic debate simulations in the near future.

## üìñ Background: A Fork of Perplexica

This project is a fork of the repository **[Perplexica](https://github.com/your-original-repo-link)**. While it retains the foundational concepts, I have reimagined and transformed it into **Win Your Argument**. By introducing powerful integrations and innovative features, this project is tailored to meet my vision of an argument-enhancing AI system.

---

## üåü Features

- **AI-Driven Argumentation:** Utilize advanced AI to enhance arguments with data-backed insights.
- **Groq Integration:** Real-time computational capabilities for efficient data processing.
- **Gemini APIs:** Generate and refine arguments using cutting-edge AI models.
- **SearchXNG:** Access and explore an extensive library of research papers for evidence-based claims.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines retrieval systems and generative models for comprehensive solutions.
- **(Coming Soon) MUN Mode:** Participate in debate simulations to practice and refine argumentation skills dynamically.
